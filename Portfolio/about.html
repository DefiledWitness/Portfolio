    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="image.png" alt="Your Photo" class="profile-photo">
    <p>My name is Surya Pai, and I am an aspiring computer scientist who loves coding. I have been coding for a large amount of time and have gone to hackathons, and am hoping to pursue computer science in the future. Coding is something that makes me happy as I code in fullstack or python, and I want to continue coding for a while. I am currently in CSE and am soon to be in CSP, and want to keep taking CS related courses for the rest of high school.</p>
    <p>I have been to hackathons, and have done personal projects to keep coding. I have gone to classes and learned from mentors and guest speakers who have pushed my interests forward and have opened my eyes to the world of coding and how it works in the real world. In terms of engineering, I have worked with mechanical and have CADDED with softwares like onshape, and have also tried coding with robotics and have done more. In the future, my goal is to become proficient with pythonl, fullstack, and become knowledgeable with many other coding lanuages.</p>
